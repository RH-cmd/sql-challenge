# SQL Challenge - Employee Database: A Mystery in Two Parts

## Background

It is a beautiful spring day, and it is two weeks since you have been hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard. Your first major task is a research project on employees of the corporation from the 1980s and 1990s. All that remain of the database of employees from that period are six CSV files.

In this assignment, you will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, you will perform:

1. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

#### Data Modeling

Inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables.

#### Data Engineering

* Use the information you have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Remember to specify data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

```
-- Create tables and import data
-- Drop table if exists
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS departments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dept_emp;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS dept_manager;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS employees;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS salaries;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS titles;

CREATE TABLE "departments" (
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "dept_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_departments" PRIMARY KEY (
        "dept_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "dept_emp" (
    "emp_no" INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_dept_emp" PRIMARY KEY (
        "emp_no","dept_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "dept_manager" (
    "dept_no" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "emp_no" INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_dept_manager" PRIMARY KEY (
        "dept_no","emp_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "employees" (
    "emp_no" INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    "emp_title_id" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "birth_date" DATE   NOT NULL,
    "first_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "last_name" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "sex" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "hire_date" DATE   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_employees" PRIMARY KEY (
        "emp_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "salaries" (
    "emp_no" INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    "salary" INTEGER   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_salaries" PRIMARY KEY (
        "emp_no"
     )
);

CREATE TABLE "titles" (
    "title_id" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    "titles" VARCHAR   NOT NULL,
    CONSTRAINT "pk_titles" PRIMARY KEY (
        "title_id"
     )
);

ALTER TABLE "dept_emp" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_dept_emp_emp_no" FOREIGN KEY("emp_no")
REFERENCES "employees" ("emp_no");

ALTER TABLE "dept_emp" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_dept_emp_dept_no" FOREIGN KEY("dept_no")
REFERENCES "departments" ("dept_no");

ALTER TABLE "dept_manager" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_dept_manager_dept_no" FOREIGN KEY("dept_no")
REFERENCES "departments" ("dept_no");

ALTER TABLE "dept_manager" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_dept_manager_emp_no" FOREIGN KEY("emp_no")
REFERENCES "employees" ("emp_no");

ALTER TABLE "employees" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_employees_emp_title_id" FOREIGN KEY("emp_title_id")
REFERENCES "titles" ("title_id");

ALTER TABLE "salaries" ADD CONSTRAINT "fk_salaries_emp_no" FOREIGN KEY("emp_no")
REFERENCES "employees" ("emp_no");

#### Data Analysis

Once you have a complete database, do the following:

1. List the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary.

```
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, employees.sex, salaries.salary
FROM employees
LEFT JOIN salaries
ON employees.emp_no = salaries.emp_no
ORDER BY employees.emp_no;
```

2. List first name, last name, and hire date for employees who were hired in 1986.

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, hire_date
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '1986-01-01' AND '1986-12-31';
```

3. List the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name.

```
SELECT dept_manager.dept_no, departments.dept_name, dept_manager.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name
FROM dept_manager
INNER JOIN departments
ON dept_manager.dept_no = departments.dept_no
INNER JOIN employees
ON dept_manager.emp_no = employees.emp_no;
```

4. List the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

```
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no;
```


5. List first name, last name, and sex for employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

```
SELECT first_name, last_name, sex
FROM employees
WHERE first_name = 'Hercules' AND last_name LIKE 'B%';
```

6. List all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

```
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name = 'Sales';
```

7. List all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

```
SELECT employees.emp_no, employees.last_name, employees.first_name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN dept_emp
ON employees.emp_no = dept_emp.emp_no
INNER JOIN departments
ON dept_emp.dept_no = departments.dept_no
WHERE departments.dept_name IN ('Sales', 'Development');
```

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.

```
SELECT last_name, COUNT(last_name) 
FROM employees
GROUP BY last_name
ORDER BY COUNT(last_name) DESC;
```

## Bonus

As you examine the data, you are overcome with a creeping suspicion that the dataset is fake. You surmise that your boss handed you spurious data in order to test the data engineering skills of a new employee. To confirm your hunch, you decide to take the following steps to generate a visualization of the data, with which you will confront your boss:

1. Import the SQL database into Pandas. (Yes, you could read the CSVs directly in Pandas, but you are, after all, trying to prove your technical mettle.) 

2. Create a histogram to visualize the most common salary ranges for employees.

3. Create a bar chart of average salary by title.

## Epilogue

Evidence in hand, you march into your boss's office and present the visualization. With a sly grin, your boss thanks you for your work. On your way out of the office, you hear the words, "Search your ID number." You look down at your badge to see that your employee ID number is 499942.
